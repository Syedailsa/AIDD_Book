## Prompt

Now do Task T007. read the SQLAlchemy (Asyncio) docs using context7 and append the summary to 'tech_specs/core_docs.md'.

## Response snapshot

Completed documentation gathering for SQLAlchemy (Asyncio) (T007) and updated `tech_specs/core_docs.md`. `specs/robotics-textbook/tasks.md` was already marked as complete.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Gathered documentation for SQLAlchemy (Asyncio) and confirmed T007 is complete.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were generated or run.
- 📁 Files: `tech_specs/core_docs.md` updated. `specs/robotics-textbook/tasks.md` was already complete.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with implementation or other user requests.
- 🧠 Reflection: Made a mistake by attempting to mark an already completed task. Need to be more careful in checking task status.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `check-prerequisites.ps1` script failed to correctly identify the feature directory. Attempted to edit an already completed task.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate and fix the `check-prerequisites.ps1` script's feature directory detection. Improve internal state management of task completion to avoid redundant edits.
