# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the official textbook for the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** course.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital screens into the physical world. This course bridges the gap between the **Digital Brain** (LLMs, VLA models) and the **Physical Body** (Humanoid Robots). 

You will move beyond "Chatbots" to "Embodied Intelligence," learning to design, simulate, and control robots using industry-standard tools like **ROS 2**, **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, and **Gazebo**.

## What You Will Learn

This book is structured to guide you step-by-step from theory to simulation:

* **Week 1: Foundations** — Understanding the shift from Digital AI to Physical AI.
* **Week 2: The Hardware** — Mastering the sensors (LiDAR, Cameras) and compute (Jetson Orin) that power humanoids.
* **Week 3: The Nervous System** — Learning ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) architecture.
* **Week 4: The Bridge** — Connecting Python AI Agents to physical robot controllers.

## Prerequisites

* Basic proficiency in **Python**.
* Familiarity with command-line interfaces (**Linux/Bash**).
* A curiosity for how machines perceive and manipulate the physical world.
